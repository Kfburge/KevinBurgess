					<h1>Cultural Reflection<br />
					</h1>
					<br />
					<p>	My time at Clemson University learning Japanese has been a journey of patience, perseverance, and
						cultural revelation. Language learning is not just about vocab and grammatical understanding. It
						is about learning that culture is inseparable from language. Personally, learning Japanese
						culture was a lesson in understanding beliefs and perspectives far from my background as an
						American. It forced me to reflect on my own values and society and has led me to appreciate our
						culture’s differences. In this paper I will discuss a few specific examples what I learned while
						learning Japanese. I believe that learning Japanese culture and language helped me to develop
						into a more globally minded individual and has inspired me to function as a cultural bridge
						between Japan and the US for the rest of my life.

					<p>One part of learning about Japanese culture included understanding how intersocial relationships
						are expressed and performed in society. An example of how the US and Japanese culture can differ
						in this regard relates to how intersocial networks are expressed through verbal and non-verbal
						communication. The Japanese social structures of 家 (uchi） and 外(soto) relationships and how
						あげる(ageru), くれる(kureru), and もらう(morau) denote one’s place in relation to those around them are
						a foundational part of communication. For example, 家refers to your inner circle of friends and
						family who are close while 外refers to those outside of that circle. This association determines
						how you use the verbs あげる/くれる/もらう which if were translated to English, roughly means
						give/give/receive, respectively. The difference between あげるand くれる is that くれるrefers to someone
						outside the circle, or 外, giving someone considered a part of your inner circle something.
						Whereas もらうrefers to the recipient’s point of view. To an American, this sort of explicit use of
						language to establish a context of how close one is with the subjects of the sentence is a
						foreign concept. The verb of “receiving” is unchanged regardless of how close one is to the
						recipient. The implication of using くれる for another family member receiving something is that by
						someone giving to my family member, I am technically also receiving something since my family or
						家 has benefitted. What this illustrates is the importance of social context in Japanese, and how
						this subtle grammatical indicator can inform the listener of how one is viewed in the context of
						家and 外. This social awareness is far removed from English and US culture where explicitly
						referring to someone as close or otherwise can be interpreted as rude. But to a Japanese
						speaker, the value in using this form of language comes from the value of affirming one’s
						relationships to those close to them. Learning this as an American made me reflect on how I
						affirm those close to me. There is not a one-to-one translation, but I believe its learning
						about the differences in how we express ourselves to be of great personal value.</p>

					<p>Following this comparison of culture through language, Japanese involves various forms speech
						that help to contextualize intersocial relationships. Keigo敬語or “honorific language” is the most
						widespread form of speech used for this purpose. Divided into three main distinctions:
						尊敬語(son-kei-go) ,丁寧語(tei-nei-go), and 謙譲語(ken-jou-go) the common default language is usually 丁寧語
						or “polite language” which involves common sentence ending structures such as “masu, desu” forms
						most often used as common courtesy to strangers and general acquaintances. 尊敬語refers to
						honorific language that is used towards one’s superiors. This could be a boss, an elder, or
						customers and changes sentence ending forms and even change verbs such as 食べる (to eat) to 召し上がる.
						Finally, there is 謙譲語or “humble language” which you use to refer to yourself humbly. This
						language can be used in the same context as speaking to a superior, but instead of talking about
						your superior you are referring to actions and things that pertain to you. Initially these three
						forms of speaking seem strange from the perspective of an American, where implying that someone
						is above or below you could be viewed by others as rude. But there is an additional layer to
						this form of speech. Often humble language is used by one’s own volition to remain humble and
						keep from boasting. Honorific language on the other hand can be used to pay respect to someone
						who has more experience than you and who may be able to teach or guide you such as an elder or
						work senior. That is not to say there are no issues with this form of language especially when
						it comes to certain social environments, but many Japanese people use keigo as a personal choice
						to respect others and remain modest. Perhaps an admirable attribute like this may be worthwhile
						for the US.</p>

					<p>Learning about Japanese culture and language has been a journey of understanding. Understanding
						myself and my limitations as a language learner as well as a learner Japanese culture and its
						people. I can not say that I fully understand the Japanese perspective, but it has inspired me
						to continue seeking out viewpoints different from my own. When I would speak with Japanese
						teachers and students, there was a world of ideas to explore, questions to ask, and answers to
						find. Even learning the language of Japanese intersocial expression, can reveal much about their
						culture and by comparing can reveal parts of my own culture. I believe that cobbling together a
						sort of universal truth in how we as humans, despite our far-flung origins, have much in common
						and much to offer each other in our collaborations is the beauty of international relations. It
						is with this foundation in my heart that I will continue this journey and seek to my studies in
						Japan beyond my time at Clemson.</p>
